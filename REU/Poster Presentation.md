# The Poster Rundown
---
## Introduction
we want as few words as possible while still getting everything important across to the reader. Also we need graphs and pictures. Dr. Li made some suggestions, but so far for images we can use
1. plotted charts of sway area and the mediolateral and anteroposterior displacement.
2. plotted charts of the multi-scale entropy
3. the confusion matrix for the eventual machine learning algorithms
4. charts of the effectiveness of each algorithm

ok so those are some of the things we can use and those can be obtained literally any time. For now lets focus on what we want to write.

### the beginning words of science
<u>**Enhancing early diagnosis of autism with machine learning algorithms using postural control features**</u> <-- Title of project

**Background**: Diagnosis of ASD occurs in a non-clinical way that is often based on the behavioral and motor symptoms of the person in question. The goal of this research is to use the motor instability found in adolescence with ASD and use machine learning algorithms aid in prediction and diagnosis of children with ASD. Different tests were performed on children to determine key features regarding their center of pressure (COP). While standing at quiet rest the children were asked to stand still with their eyes open, and then stand still with their eyes shut for 30 seconds each time on a force plate gathering COP data.
