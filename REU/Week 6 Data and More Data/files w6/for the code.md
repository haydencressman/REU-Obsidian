## Steps to Take
1. Create the code so that is just does what has been done before. This time though check the [EntropyHub](https://www.entropyhub.xyz) documentation and see how to use the functions they already give us. Also read what Dr. Li said about the tau and what it should be or if it should just stay 1 or whatever it is as default.
2. Ok this might have to come first but use both pandas and glob to grab all the files within that dataset that was given to you by Dr. Li so that you don't have to hand type each and every file path like a dirty ape.
3. Figure out how to *write* this newfound data into an excel spreadsheet and maybe save and label different graphs for later use.

This is going to take a while so just get the part where you get all the files and their data separately first, and worry about the algorithms and output later.
