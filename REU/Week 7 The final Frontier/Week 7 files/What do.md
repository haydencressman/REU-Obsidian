So for this week we need to do pretty much the most things we have done before ever in our history of being alive.

---
## Work on the code
Finish up the Sklearn stuff and put notes you have found here below this double pound sign


## Work on the poster
Please for the love of god may this poster look really really good, we kind of need to have a bit of it done before wednesday so that dr li can look at it, and if not we can always just email it to him to see what he thinks of it. I would rather we get the layout of it done before the weekend so that if we just need more pictures and graphs and stuff we can just get those then and then add them, although I am not sure as to why we would wait to see that

Anyways as far as what data to include you can do the confusion matrices for the different algorithms, and then the graphs of both the entropy and the COP data. as far as the methods go you can talk about
1. gathering the data
2. using python for the machine learning code, sklearn, entropyhub, all that
3. comparing the accuracy and quality of each of the classifiers? who knows, we don't even have the code working yet
