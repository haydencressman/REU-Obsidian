## notes from the meeting about .md, latex, word etc.
### markdown

can get a plugin to use markdown in emails and such.
R is in markdown apparently. Outlook? whatever should work with an extension/addon.

### [pandoc](https://pandoc.org)

a useful tool for file conversion. it is used in the command line (on mac ?). so it basically compiles the file into another format using commands like -s and -o. Good to know the syntax. Some limitations to conversion.

### [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org)

TeXstudio is an IDE for latex. Can use LaTeX to create circuit diagrams via code and such. ==Draw.io is good for drawing circuits too.==

### Sourcetreeapp/Git software

Usage of GIT from the console or through this sourcetree software or through another app to make a repo and clone or push or whatever the repo. He is using the terminal since it is GIT and not a GUI. I did not know Git was just a normal thing with like a GUI. Look into it. It can also show specific differences between versions. I think it is through sourcetree app itself.
