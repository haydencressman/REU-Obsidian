Documentation, storage, poster: three things needed to be done before the end of the year. 
Documentation: Talk with Dr. Li about the deliverables. 

Storage:Talk with Dr. Li about where to store the code and data. I think he already explained what to do for the endgame but just ask him later.

Poster: Look at templates for poster. Requirements, ==institutional logo (UTPB)! and Texas State Logo and REU Logo.== Engineering faculty will be there (and so will the other REU sites). Either Wednesday or Thursday of the last week. Make the poster in powerpoint.
