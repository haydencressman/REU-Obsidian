### Introduction:
Postural control is derived from the interaction of multiple sensorimotor processes, includng many physiological systems such as biomechanical constraints, movement strategies, sensory strategies, orientation in space, control of dynamics, and cognitive processing. The central nervous system recieves, combines, and organizes visual, [somatosensory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system), and [vestibular information](https://www.britannica.com/science/vestibular-system) to produce an appropriate motor response.
