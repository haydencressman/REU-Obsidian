[Piezoelectric Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity)

Postural Sway is applied to variations in the COP position, and displacement of the COM are attributed to body sway. Multiaxis plates allow the horizontal COM displacements to be calculated from the double integration of the ML and AP component of the ground reaction force divided by the mass. Initial velocity and position of the COM cannot be calculated however there are some theoretical means of doing so.

[Spectral Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_power_distribution) is the power frequency of the COP signal. Frequency band distribution of frequency content of the COP signal.

### **Reading Part 3**
Introduction:

                [Autism spectrum disorder](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html) (ASD) have noticeable deficiencies in their motor and social skills which could lead to more sedentary lifestyles. Deficiencies in [[Week one definitions#Gait|gait]], [[Week one definitions#Postural Stability|postural stability]], [[Week one definitions#Manual Dexterity|manual dexterity]], and [[Week one definitions#Locomotor Skills|locomotor skills]] have been reported. Problems with neural abnormalities with [[Week one definitions#Sensory Integration|sensory integration]] and general neural circuitry have been hypothesized to be root causes of these issues. The role of visual, vestibular, and, [somatosensory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system) systems are linked to postural stability. Linkage between [fine and gross motor skills](https://www.healthline.com/health/childrens-health/gross-motor-skills#vs-fine-motor) are also linked to these issues.

Methods:

                [Test of Gross Motor Development, 3rd Edition](https://www.therapro.com/Browse-Category/Gross-Motor-Fine-Motor/TGMD-3-Complete-Kit.html) (TGMD-3) is used to assess gross motor skills. Also, the [RBS-R questionnaire](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/assessments/rbs-r.html) was used prior to testing. Using [multiple linear regression](<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mlr.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Multiple%20linear%20regression%20(MLR)%2C%20also%20known%20simply%20as%20multiple,uses%20just%20one%20explanatory%20variable.>) for the data gathered: sex, diagnosis, age, RBS-R overall intensity score, solid surface sway area, compliant surface sway area, using a [t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test). Alpha level was set to .05. [b-values and P-values](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/regression-table/#:~:text=The%20first%20symbol%20is%20the,variable%20increases%20by%201.57%20units.) were obtained from the data and presented.

Results:

                TGMD-3 total score was significantly associated with postural sway area on the solid surface condition, the diagnosis, and the age of the child. TGMD-3 was not found to be associated with these things under compliant surface conditions. Results of the [ANOVA](<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anova.asp#:~:text=Analysis%20of%20variance%20(ANOVA)%20is,the%20random%20factors%20do%20not.>) found that children with ASD had a greater postural sway area when compared to non-ASD children, and overall, each group had higher postural sway. Children with ASD score lower on the TGMD-3.

Discussion:

                These tests were used to examine the relationship between motor skill performance and postural stability, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior in children with and without ASD. Different [[Week one definitions#Graph Data 2|graphs]] were shown depicting the Medio-Lateral COP sway data obtained during the test. Age plays a factor, with postural stability increasing with age, implying that motor skills and stability can be a learned feature. Proprioceptive information was modified whereas visual information was not. RBS-R scores were found to not be good indicators of individuals in need of motor skill intervention.
