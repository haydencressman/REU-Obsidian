# Stability
Mechanically the resistance to both linear and angular acceleration, or resistance to disruption to equilibrium. This has many factors since it is based off of Newton's Second Law, F = ma. The friction required to move a body also affects its stability.

# Balance
A persons ability to control equilibrium.

# Base of Support
Consists of the area enclosed by the outermost edges of the body in contact with the supporting surface or surfaces. When a body's center of gravity (CG) moves outside the base of the support, this tends to cause a torque to be applied with the CG falling towards the ground.

Torque is measured by force times distance, Nm.

# Gait
A person's manner of walking. Gait abnormalities can be found [here](https://stanfordmedicine25.stanford.edu/the25/gait.html)

# Postural Stability
The ability to control the body position in space for the purpose of movement and balance.

# Manual Dexterity
The ability to use your hands in a skillful, coordinated way to grasp and manipulate objects and demonstrate small precise movements.

# Locomotor Skills
Basic movements to get from one place to another, such as walking, running, jumping, skipping, crawling, etc.

# Sensory Integration
Describes processes in the brain that take information from the 5 basic senses, process it, and then act accordingly to the information gathered. There are three levels, [tactile](https://harkla.co/blogs/special-needs/tactile-system#:~:text=The%20tactile%20system%20is%20part,system%20to%20develop%20in%20utero.), [vestibular](https://www.britannica.com/science/vestibular-system), and [proprioceptive](https://sensory-processing.middletownautism.com/sensory-strategies/strategies-according-to-sense/proprioceptive/#:~:text=The%20proprioceptive%20system%20is%20located,controlling%20responses%20to%20sensory%20stimuli.).
