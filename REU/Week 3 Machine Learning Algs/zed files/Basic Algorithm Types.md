- Supervised Learning

Classification and Regression

- Un-Supervised Learning

Association and Clustering

- Reinforcement Learning


## <u>Popular Algorithms</u>
- Linear Regression (Predictive, formulaic)
- Logistic Regression (Predictive, formulaic)
- Decision Tree (Simple, needs cutoff values)
- Random Forest (Similar to Decision Tree)
- K Nearest Neighbors (Predictive of new data based on nearest data points)
