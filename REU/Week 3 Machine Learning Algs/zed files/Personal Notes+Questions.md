Also ask about how the data is actually going to be handled since it seems like the data is just going to include the area values, so that's only 1 instance of data. The other data could be gotten from whether or not the area value is for an ASD individual but I am unsure.

See if there's a way to just sort the new data and old data by ascending order and compare the data at each point against various <u> gathered</u> data, like the new set of data would be overlayed on top of other classified data and see if its closer one way or another. that might just be nearest neighbor though.
